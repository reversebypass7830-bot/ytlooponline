### Prerequisites — all platforms

| Tool    | Version | Install |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Git     | any     | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |
| Node.js | 24.16.0 | \`mise install\` or \`.node-version\` |
| Bun     | 1.2.23  | \`mise install\` or \`package.json\` \`packageManager\` |

Recommended: install \`mise\`, then run \`mise install\` in the checkout. Without mise, manually activate Node.js from \`.node-version\` and Bun from \`package.json\` before \`bun run bootstrap\`.

### Windows

\`\`\`powershell
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
\`\`\`

Visual Studio Build Tools and Python may be needed for native rebuilds.

### macOS

\`\`\`bash
brew install mise
xcode-select --install
\`\`\`

After cloning, run \`mise trust && mise install\` from the checkout. If your shell already uses \`fnm\`, \`nvm\`, or a Homebrew Bun, activate mise in \`~/.zshrc\` so Arroxy gets Node.js 24.16.0 and Bun 1.2.23:

\`\`\`bash
printf '\n# mise\nif command -v mise >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(mise activate zsh)"\nfi\n' >> ~/.zshrc
exec zsh
\`\`\`

### Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)

\`\`\`bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Build + Electron runtime deps
sudo apt install -y build-essential python3 tar libgtk-3-0 libnss3 libasound2t64

# E2E tests only (Electron needs a display)
sudo apt install -y xvfb
\`\`\`

### Clone & run

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/antonio-orionus/Arroxy
cd Arroxy
mise trust
mise install           # recommended; skip if you manually activated the pinned tools
bun run bootstrap
bun run doctor
bun run dev            # Electron app against the Vite renderer
\`\`\`

### Build a distributable

\`\`\`bash
bun run build        # typecheck + compile
bun run dist         # package for current OS
bun run dist:win     # package Windows targets when run on a supported host
\`\`\`

> \`bun run bootstrap\` installs dependencies, rebuilds Electron app dependencies, verifies Electron, prepares embedded ffmpeg/ffprobe for development, and installs Playwright Chromium. yt-dlp is managed at runtime in your app data folder; ffmpeg and ffprobe are bundled with every Arroxy release.
