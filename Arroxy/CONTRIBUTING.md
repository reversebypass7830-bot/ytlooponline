# Contributing to Arroxy

Thanks for thinking about contributing! Bug reports, fixes, and small features are all welcome.

This document covers the essentials. If anything is unclear, open an issue and ask.

---

### Branch policy

Arroxy uses a single long-lived branch, **`main`**. Open contributor PRs against `main`. Feature work happens on short-lived feature branches in your fork and merges into `main` when ready.

### Contributor flow

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch in your fork.
3. Open a PR into `main`.
4. Wait for CI and maintainer review.

### Maintainer release flow

1. Contributor work lands on `main`.
2. Maintainers cut `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` tags from `main` for validation. Pre-release tags are auto-marked `prerelease: true` on GitHub and do not auto-update existing user installs.
3. After validation, bump `package.json` to the stable version on `main`.
4. Cut `vX.Y.Z` from `main`; stable package-manager publishing (Scoop, Homebrew, Winget) only happens for these stable tags.

### Registry package flows

`yt-dlp-bridge` and `ytdlp-errors` live under `packages/` and are published to npmjs.com from this repository. Package PRs use the same Arroxy CI gate as app PRs.

Maintainers publish `yt-dlp-bridge` by bumping `packages/yt-dlp-bridge/package.json`, merging to `main`, then pushing a tag named `yt-dlp-bridge-vX.Y.Z`.

Maintainers publish `ytdlp-errors` by bumping `packages/ytdlp-errors/package.json`, merging to `main`, then pushing a tag named `ytdlp-errors-vX.Y.Z`.

Both registry workflows build tarballs with Bun, then publish through registry trusted publishing. They do not use long-lived registry publish tokens.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Use the [issue templates](https://github.com/antonio-orionus/Arroxy/issues/new/choose). For bugs, include:

- OS + version (e.g. Windows 11 23H2, macOS 14.4, Ubuntu 24.04)
- Install channel (NSIS installer, Portable, Scoop, Homebrew, Winget, AppImage, tar.gz, Flatpak, DMG)
- Arroxy version (visible in the title bar / Settings)
- A URL or scenario that reproduces it, plus the failure mode (error text, log line, screenshot)

## Local development

Recommended prerequisites: [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev), plus the native OS packages listed below. The shared `mise.toml` pins Node.js and Bun for this repo.

If you do not use mise, install Node.js from `.node-version` and Bun from the root `package.json` `packageManager` field. Bun must already be available before `bun run bootstrap`; bootstrap repairs project-local dependencies and managed binaries, but it does not install Bun itself.

Bun installs JavaScript dependencies, but it does not replace native OS prerequisites.

- macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools may be needed for native rebuilds.
- Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools and Python may be needed for native rebuilds.
- Linux: Electron GUI libraries, compiler toolchain, Python, `tar`, and Playwright browser dependencies may be needed.

Run `bun run doctor` after setup. It reports the specific missing tool or artifact when possible.

### Quick start on macOS

```bash
brew install mise
xcode-select --install

git clone https://github.com/antonio-orionus/Arroxy.git
cd Arroxy
mise trust
mise install
bun run bootstrap
bun run doctor
bun run dev          # runs the Electron app against the Vite renderer
```

Make mise active in new zsh tabs so the repo-pinned Node.js and Bun versions win over global installs:

```bash
printf '\n# mise\nif command -v mise >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(mise activate zsh)"\nfi\n' >> ~/.zshrc
exec zsh
```

If `bun run doctor` reports a newer Node.js from `fnm` or a newer Bun from Homebrew, mise is installed but not active for the shell. Confirm from the repo root:

```bash
which node
which bun
node --version       # expected: v24.16.0
bun --version        # expected: 1.2.23
```

As a one-off workaround before fixing shell activation, run commands through mise:

```bash
mise exec -- bun run doctor
mise exec -- bun run dev
```

### Cross-platform quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antonio-orionus/Arroxy.git
cd Arroxy
mise trust
mise install
bun run bootstrap
bun run doctor
bun run dev          # runs the Electron app against the Vite renderer
```

Without mise, manually activate the versions from `.node-version` and `package.json`, then run `bun run bootstrap`, `bun run doctor`, and `bun run dev`.

For pure-renderer / UI work without the Electron shell:

```bash
bun run dev:mock
```

The renderer's `browserMock.ts` stubs `window.appApi` only in explicit `browser-mock` mode so the wizard, queue, and update banner all simulate without a backend. Electron dev and packaged builds use the real preload bridge.

If you use git worktrees, create them with your own tool or harness, then run `bun run bootstrap` inside the new worktree.

Playwright browser downloads use Playwright's normal user cache by default. If you need a strictly repo-local browser cache for a throwaway checkout, run commands with `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$PWD/.playwright-browsers"`; that local cache path is ignored by Git.

## Required pre-PR checks

Run the full local gate before opening a PR. CI gates on the same checks.

```bash
bun run check       # format + lint + tooling contract + typecheck + knip + madge + LOC + pins + i18n + tests + package gates
```

The root-owned tooling contract is documented in [`dev-docs/tooling-contract.md`](dev-docs/tooling-contract.md). New workspace packages must be wired into that contract before merging.

## Building installers locally (optional)

```bash
bun run dist:linux   # AppImage + tar.gz + Flatpak inputs
bun run dist:mac     # arm64 + x64 DMG (requires macOS host)
bun run dist:win     # NSIS installer + Portable .exe (Windows host)
```

## Coding conventions

- **TypeScript-strict.** No `any` / `unknown` without justification.
- **Naming.** Reuse the domain glossary in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md). Don't introduce parallel vocabularies.
- **Architecture.** Renderer should not know how main fetches; main should not know which component renders. IPC channel names live in `src/shared/ipc.ts`; payload types live in `src/shared/types.ts`.
- **Comments.** Don't restate what code already says. Comment when WHY is non-obvious — a hidden constraint, an OS-specific quirk, a workaround for a specific bug.
- **No backwards-compat shims.** Delete old code rather than aliasing or re-exporting.
- **Mature libraries over bespoke code** for validation, HTTP, ORM, auth, logging, etc.

## Commit & PR conventions

- **Conventional Commits.** Subject ≤ ~70 chars: `fix(scope): …`, `feat(scope): …`, `refactor: …`, `build: …`, `docs: …`. Body explains the _why_, not the _what_.
- **No AI attribution.** Do **not** add `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailers or `🤖 Generated with …` footers to commits or PR bodies. Write as if authored solely by yourself.
- **Small, separable commits.** If your PR has two unrelated concerns, make them two commits — reviewers may take one and not the other.
- **Sign your commits** if your Git identity is set up for it. Not required.
