// A successful version probe is a durable fact about one exact file, but the
// resolver was re-establishing it on every launch. On macOS that meant paying
// yt-dlp's ~30s onefile unpack-and-scan before the window would open, every
// single time.
//
// Identity is (path, size, mtimeMs) rather than a content hash: managed
// artifacts already live under a content-addressed directory, and hashing a
// 35MB binary to avoid spawning it would trade one cost for another. Any
// replacement — an upgrade in place, a re-materialized artifact, a different
// PATH entry — moves at least one of the three and re-probes.
//
// Only successes are recorded. A failure is a fact about the environment at one
// moment (a scanner mid-update, a machine under load) and must not be cached.
// Backstop for the case forgetProbeVerdict cannot see: a binary that stops
// running for a reason no spawn ever reports back to us. Long enough that the
// memo still does its job across a normal week of launches, short enough that a
// stale verdict cannot outlive a yt-dlp release cycle.
