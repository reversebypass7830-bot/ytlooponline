/**
 * Pure: given the manifest and the dir listing, produce extended-M3U text.
 * Entries are emitted in playlist order; an item is included only when it has
 * a videoId AND a playable media file whose name ends with `[<videoId>].<ext>`.
 *
 * The manifest holds the *entire* probed playlist (every entry), not just the
 * items the user queued this run — see `submitWizardToQueue`, which registers
 * `playlistItems` while queueing only the selected subset. Combined with the
 * disk scan here, that makes the M3U self-healing across partial downloads:
 *
 * - Sync-with-folder: re-adding an already-downloaded playlist queues only the
 *   newly-added videos, yet when one finishes the M3U is rebuilt from the full
 *   manifest and lists every file on disk (old + new) — the new entries are
 *   effectively appended, in playlist order, overwriting the prior `.m3u`.
 * - A skipped/failed item simply isn't on disk, so it's omitted until a later
 *   run downloads it, at which point the next rebuild includes it.
