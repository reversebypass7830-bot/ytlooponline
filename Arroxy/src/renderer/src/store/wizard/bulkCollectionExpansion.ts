// Bulk intake expands collection URLs before any row exists.
//
// A bulk row becomes exactly one download job, and a job carries one filename
// bound before it runs. So a collection URL sitting in a bulk row is not a
// cosmetic problem: `--no-playlist` is inert on a bare `/playlist?list=…`,
// `@channel` or `/results?search_query=…`, and yt-dlp downloads the whole set
// under that one name. Quick Download already expands these (it probes with
// `playlistMode: 'playlist'` and queues one job per entry); this gives the bulk
// list the same treatment so the two paths agree.
//
// Expansion runs before projection rather than during hydration because
// hydration addresses rows by position — splicing entries in mid-run would
// shift every later row out from under its in-flight worker.
