// Two callers reach the yt-dlp resolver on a cold start and neither knows about
// the other: the splash's warmup, and QueueService's boot-time respawn pass.
// `this.resolved` only memoizes *completed* resolutions, so both used to run the
// whole chain and both used to call materialize(). The artifact lock stopped
// them corrupting the cache, but the second caller blocked on that lock emitting
// no progress at all — a frozen splash — and once a slow link pushed the first
// download past the lock timeout, the second was handed a fabricated 'timeout'
// attempt and fell through to the next mirror, downloading the same binary
// twice. These tests hold the resolver to one run per dependency.
